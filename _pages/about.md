# In the classroom, I emphasize process-based learning through completion-graded assignments and continual student feedback throughout the lifecycle of a course. I believe in understanding studentsâ€™ individual starting points and engaging with them from there, being particularly mindful of those coming from diverse educational backgrounds outside of the sciences and engineering.

Hello! My research sits at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, with a focus on observational methods: how do we build an understanding of the world when we cannot run a randomized experiment? 

I develop machine learning approaches that improve observational causal methodology in order to answer causal questions in complex data domains. Alongside my awesome collaborators, I use these methods across data science applications in public health, social communication, mental wellness, and medicine.
