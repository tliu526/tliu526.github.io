Hello! My research sits at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, with a focus on observational methods: how do we build an understanding of the world when we cannot run a randomized experiment? 

I develop machine learning methods that improve traditional observational causal methodology in order to answer causal questions in complex data domains. Alongside my awesome collaborators, I use these methods across data science applications in public health, social communication, mental wellness, and medicine.

In the classroom, I emphasize process-based learning through completion-graded assignments and continual student feedback throughout the lifecycle of a course. I believe in understanding students' individual starting points and engaging with them from there, being particularly mindful of those coming from diverse educational backgrounds outside of the sciences and engineering.
